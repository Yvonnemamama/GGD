## Generated Graph Detection

#### This is Pytorch implementation of Generated Graph Detection, as described in our paper:

## Step 0: Datasets

#### The datasets used in our paper, 

    ["AIDS", "alchemy_full", "deezer_ego_nets", "DBLP_v1", "github_stargazers", "COLLAB", "twitch_egos"]
#### All datasets can be obtained in https://chrsmrrs.github.io/datasets/

## Step 1: Graph Generation

#### We follow the instruction on https://github.com/xiangsheng1325/GraphGenerator to generate graphs based on Graphite, GRAN, sbmgnn, vgae.

#### We follow the instruction on https://github.com/JiaxuanYou/graph-generation to generate graphs based on GraphRNN, GraphVAE.

#### The generated graphs based on ER and BA can be generated by the following commands:

    python3 main.py -e Generate_ER -d AIDS
    python3 main.py -e Generate_BA -d AIDS

## Step 2: Sample dataset

    python3 main.py -e sample_dataset -d AIDS

## Step 3: Run experiments

    python3 main.py -e train_models -d AIDS -o .pkl -s s1
